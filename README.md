# How the server is run
---
Our server is a full-stack implementation of a LAMP server setup.
We are running Debian 7, Apache server, Mongodb and python-Flask.

For mapping the travel of the torch we are using Google Maps API, with on-the-fly javascript creation.

Updating the database is done via POST requests.
